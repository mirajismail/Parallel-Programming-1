# Q4

Implementation of small examples of serial and parallel DAXPY are written in serial\_daxpy.cpp and parallel\_daxpy.cpp respectively. In daxpy\_large.cpp, the logic is the same as the aforementioned implmentation, and uses an rarray of size 1000 by 1000 by 1000. The time analysese are available in small\_serial\_daxpy.txt, small\_parallel\_daxpy.cpp and large\_daxpy\_analysis.txt. From large\_daxpy\_analysis.txt, large\_efficiency\_analysis.txt shows the calculated efficiency -> it appears the program experiences best scaling between 1 - 4 threads.
