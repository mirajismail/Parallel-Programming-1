# Q1 Forms of Shared-Memory Programs

## Parallel Loops
Divide loop iterations among threads (parallel for, collapse). 

## Parallel Regions
A block executed by multiple threads (#pragma omp parallel), inside which shared-memory work happens.

## Task Parallelism
Work decomposed into independent tasks (#pragma omp task) for irregular or recursive workloads.

## Reductions
Threads compute partial results and combine them deterministically (reduction(+:...), reduction(max:...)).

## Atomic / Critical Synchronization
Serialize specific shared updates when needed (atomic, critical).
